# Playwright (TypeScript)

## Introduction

This repo is an example Playwright test suite written in TypeScript. It has been put together to demonstrate my approach
to UI testing and also as a practical example of how Playwright can be used, incorporating various techniques and tricks
I have learned throughout my professional career.

## Website Under Test

This project uses a third-party dummy retail website ([Luma](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/)) as the software
under test. The website is MUCH bigger than is ideal for this sort of exercise but if it works (which it seems to) then
that puts it streets ahead of various other websites and options I have tried.

Playwright does offer an example "to do" app that can be used for testing but the Playwright installation also includes
a sample test suite for the "to do" app so what would I be adding that hasn't already been done? I'm not showcasing my
own skills and approach if I use an app that already has a full test suite publicly available.

Also by using a third-party deployed website like the Luma store then it is easier to show how different test tools and
frameworks can be used together.
